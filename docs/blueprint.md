## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL blue (#2980b9 in hex), a measured choice inspired by the reliable tech stack. This hue creates a calm atmosphere for the dashboard environment.
- Background color: Desaturated light-bluish grey (#F4F8FA in hex) provides a gentle backdrop.
- Accent color: Green (#2ecc71 in hex), an analogous hue approximately 30 degrees away from blue on the color wheel, is reserved for successful operation and positive feedback
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface known for its clean and modern appearance, to maintain legibility across the dashboard.
- Consistent use of ShadCN UI components (cards, buttons, dialogs) for a cohesive and professional look.
- Subtle animations for task list updates and AI notifications to improve user experience.
- Dynamic transitions for UI elements (cards, charts) using fade-in and slide-in effects, creating a smooth and visually appealing interface.
